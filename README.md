My best friend. I am terrible at managing my finances. I did not mean 
for this to be a large project, just something quick and dirty.

## For Later

Tabling this project for later. I have the backend and objects, I just don't know how I want
to design the UX.

### To Implement

- `remove`
- `edit`
- `view`
- `config`

### To Think About

- what settings to include
- view options
- better way to remove entries and objects
- better way to edit entries and objects
